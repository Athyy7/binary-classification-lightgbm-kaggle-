# binary-classification-lightgbm-kaggle-
This repository contains my solution for a Kaggle classification competition. The task is to predict a binary target from tabular data. I used LightGBM as the primary model, with cross-validation and early stopping to prevent overfitting. Final predictions were thresholded at 0.5 to generate binary class labels for submission.
